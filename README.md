- Built DAX measures to compute KPIs:
  ```dax

  ‚Ä¢ ADR (Average Daily Rate) - Total Rooms Revenue/ No. of Rooms Sold
  
  ‚Ä¢ DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) = Total Rooms Available to Sell/ No. of Days
  
  ‚Ä¢ DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights) = Total Checked out/ No. of Days
  
  ‚Ä¢ DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights) = Total Bookings/No. of Days
  
  ‚Ä¢ Occupancy% = Total Rooms Occupied/ Total Rooms Available
  
  ‚Ä¢ RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) = Total Revenue / Total Rooms Available to Sell
  
  ‚Ä¢ Realization = DURN/DBRN
