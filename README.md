## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

### 1. Data Sources & Preparation
- Imported booking and property data.
- Applied Power Query transformations:
  - Removed duplicates.
  - Cleaned date formats.
  - Merged lookup tables.
- Created calculated columns and measures.

### 2. Data Model
- Defined relationships between fact and dimension tables.
- Built DAX measures to compute KPIs:
  ```dax
  Total Revenue = SUM(Bookings[Revenue])

  ADR = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Rooms Sold])

  Occupancy Rate = DIVIDE([Total Rooms Sold], [Available Rooms])

  RevPAR = [ADR] * [Occupancy Rate]
